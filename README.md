2. The computer generates a random choice using JavaScript.
3. The player's choice is compared with the computer's:
   - If the player wins, their score increases.
   - If the computer wins, its score increases.
   - If it's a draw, scores remain the same.
4. The result and updated scores are shown on the screen.

Main functions used in logic:
- A function to get the computer's choice (random selection).
- A function to compare both choices and determine the winner.
- DOM manipulation to display results and scores.
